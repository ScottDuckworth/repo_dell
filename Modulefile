summary 'Configures the Dell OMSA Yum repository config to point to a local mirror on Enterprise Linux (RHEL, CentOS) clients'
description 'Based off of http://github.com/stahnma/puppet-module-puppetlabs_yum

The repository contains an extract of all of the drivers in Server Assistant. 
Because Dell develops, tests, and ships drivers on a per-platform basis, the 
Server Assistant media contains a cross-reference for the drivers belonging to 
each system. We have extracted these drivers into a series of system-specific 
yum repositories.'
